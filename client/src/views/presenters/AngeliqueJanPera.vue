    <h3>The Early Years</h3>
    <div>
      From about the age of three, Angelique was able to feel, see and know things that others seemed not to notice.<br>
      <br>
      She would tune into her mother's friends during their visits, observing their body language, listening to the quality of their voices more than their words, paying deep attention to each one.  When she felt something that seemed out of balance she would instinctively touch them where she could sense something was problematic.  When she felt their emotional pain she would give them a hug, or stroke their hair.  To her this was normal, “sharing love”.<br>
      <br>
      Angelique was aware of seeking an actual conscious relationship with God/the Divine/All that Is, when she was about the age of five.  Unable to find others like her she tried to become mainstream as her childhood unfolded.<br>
      <br>
      At age 18, Angelique had a life-altering experience that plunged her into deep depression.  It took her back on the path of seeking. Her mother was very “trans-personal” and exposed her to many different avenues of spiritual training, courses and retreats. Angelique began to find her way during her college years.

    <h3>Psychotherapy Study</h3>
    <div>
      A couple years after college, Angelique decided to go back to school and get her degree and license as a psychotherapist. She planned her course work centered around psycho-analysis, so she could get a deep understanding of the psychological theories offered at the time.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout her graduate school years, Angelique worked with people to rid themselves of limiting beliefs, thought forms, and mistaken identities that kept them from being their Unique Selves. Helping them use their gifts, talents and abilities to maximize their creative Self Expression.

    <h3>Assisting Individuals, Couples, Families, Communities</h3>
    <div>
      Angelique's multi-dimensional work is considered unconventional, transcending traditional and mainstream ideas. She uses psychotherapy, hypnotic/trance-inducing processes, and other mind-expanding modalities, meditation, visualization, forgiveness-processes and sound-vibration energy healing, for individuals to reconnect with their Unique Identity, their unique expression of the Undivided Whole.<br>
      <br>
      Her dedication is to the understanding that “we are all One with All that Is”, and she views this as foundational to our way back to Wholeness and Wellbeing; Individually and Collectively.<br>
      <br>
      Along with this is her firm conviction that our differences provide diversity, and are meant to be celebrated, nurtured and shared with one another. It is the substance from which our depth and breadth of Love can be cultivated.<br>
      <br>
      Whether it is to find your True Self, your Life's Purpose or your Sacred Partner, Angelique chooses and employs the modalities that have the biggest potential impact. 
    </div>

    <h3>Assisting Animals</h3>
    <div>
      Angelique had her dog Luis as part of her practice for 18 years. He helped, open, sooth and calm hundreds of her clientele.<br>
      <br>
      Inspired by “we are all One with All that Is”, Angelique's practice includes healing work with animals, along with their guardians. This is accomplished with all the above modalities, as well as, homeopathic tinctures and essential oils.<br>
      <br>
      She helps people heal their ailing animals, and connect them even more deeply with one another. The healing power of dogs, and animals in general, is widely known. ALL beings are important, and have their purpose in the lives of their loved ones.
