    <div class="title center poetic">
      Mystic Artist, Writer and Spiritual Educator
    </div>

    <div class="background">
      The Mystic Art of Mary Saint-Marie began after a near-death experience in 1971,
      after years of High School and College English teaching.<br>
      <br>
      Mary experienced the Timeless Realm of the Real and saw her life via past lives, 
      present life and future life as One and as here and now. Revealed was exalted life,
      Christ Consciousness, through the eyes of Joy. Following that, Mary could see light 
      around all living things as Inner Vision opened.<br>
      <br>
      Then 33 years ago ones began to ask Mary for Soul Sessions.<br>
      <br>
      Since that near death experience, Mary has been opened to the I Am Awareness.<br>
      Following that she was opened to Archetypal Realms, the Angelic, Celestial and 
      Music of the Realms.  Sounds of the Soul. She has seen the Web of Life and 
      Web of Light of Earth and Sky as One.<br>
      <br>
      Mary is aware that we are ALL Already Whole. That is how Mary greets the ones 
      who come to her.

      as the Infinite One.<br>
      The Eternal One. <br>

      the barriers to open to the transcendent Christ Presence. Love.<br>
      <br>

      may realize themselves and all… as the Unmanifest…manifest. No separation.
