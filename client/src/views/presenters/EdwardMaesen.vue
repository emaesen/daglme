      Sound Ceremonialist, Spiritual Educator, Physicist
    </div>

    <div class="background">
      Edward Maesen is a Sound Ceremonialist and Spiritual Educator, with a Master's degree in Physics.<br>
      <br>
      From his childhood Edward has had an awareness of the multi-dimensionality of his Being… expressing itself as the innocent child, a wise guide and a non-judgemental, objective observer.<br>
      <br>
      Edward's life is a demonstration of living in tune with —and following direction of— an inner Knowing.

      Wholeness already Is.<br>

    <h3>The Journey</h3>
    <div>
      Edward's spiritual journey began in 1992 in search of relief from a long and deep existential depression.<br>
      <br>
      Shaolin Kempo martial arts brought outer and inner balance.<br>
      Painting allowed for creative expression.<br>
      Physics education challenged the mind.<br>
      Consciousness exploration workshops expanded the perception of reality.<br>
      The study and practice of several healing modalities opened the inner senses.

    <h3>Didgeridoo Dream</h3>
    <div>
      Edward took didgeridoo playing lessons but was not able to get a sound out of the bamboo practice instruments. After a few lessons he had an opportunity to check out a collection of authentic didgeridoos for sale, had a dream about a didge, recognized the one from the dream among the collection, bought that didge, and on first try after arrival home could play it, effortlesly.

    <h3>Ceremonial Living</h3>
    <div>
      In 1995 Edward made a trip to Nepal, including a mostly solitary week-long hike through Langtang National Park in the Himalayas. He was struck by the beauty and spiritual light shining through the eyes of the Nepalese people and was inspired by their ceremonial slow pace of living.

    <h3>Sound Ceremony as Celestial Initiation</h3>
    <div>
      Through the ceremonial use of sound with acoustic instruments and voice, Edward reflects the State of True Being of the Ones he is with. His songs restore balance and harmony, revitalizing and reinforcing one's connection to Self. Their sounds serve as a celestial initiation and a catalyst for healing and understanding:<br>
