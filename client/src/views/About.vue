    <h1>About the Daily Global Meditation</h1>

    <p class="margin-top20">
      The Daily Global Meditation is a call for peoples around the world to participate in a short daily meditation or prayer at 8PM local time.
      <br>
      If 8PM is an inconvenient time, one may choose any other hour of the day and align with individuals for which that hour is their local 8PM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to have enough daily participants to reach a critical mass that will produce improvements in the quality of life for mankind.
