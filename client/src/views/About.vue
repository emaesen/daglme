    <h1>About the Daily Global Meditation</h1>

    <p class="margin-top20">
      The Daily Global Meditation is a call for peoples around the world to participate in a short daily meditation or prayer at 8 o'clock in the evening (8:00 PM or 20:00) local time.
      <br>
      If 8 PM is an inconvenient time, one may choose any other hour of the day and align with individuals for which that hour is their local 8 PM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to have enough daily participants to reach a critical mass that will produce improvements in the quality of life for mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Research in 1976 found that when 1% of a community practiced Transcendental Meditation, the crime rate was reduced by 16% on average.
      This is known as the <a href="https://tmhome.com/benefits/study-maharishi-effect-group-meditation-crime-rate/" target="_blank" class="external">"Maharishi effect"</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      One doesn't need to be an experienced meditator to join our Daily Global Meditation. We suggest a focused attention daily for 5 minutes at 8 PM local time, to envision the Earth and Sky as Illumined and Whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daily Global Meditation embraces all ways, paths and practices.
